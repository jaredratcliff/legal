1. Initiate Verification
    1. In WordPress tools, initiate access/erase requests for each email address submitted by the user in the SAR. This will send a verification email to each email address, verifying the action.
    2. Notify the submitter of our receipt of the SAR and alert them to check for the verification emails.
2. Proceed with access/erase procedure, in each of the following areas:
    1. MailerLite (current email marketing provider)
    2. MailChimp (previous email marketing provider, which still has all contacts in the archive)
    3. Zoho Mail box (communications with individual in inbox, sent, spam, folders, trash)
    4. **************************************************If the request is access,************************************************** send their data archives from each of these sources to them. For Zoho mail, include PDFs of email communications.
        1. Consider notifying the user that any interaction they have left with our social media, we are unable to associate with their email address and thus can‚Äôt remove; however, they can delete those interactions themselves.
    5. Finally, complete the process in WordPress tools.
    6. ************************************************If the request is erase,************************************************ remove traces.
        1. After completion, use the option in WordPress tools to delete the request.
        2. Delete any final emails with the user in Zoho Mail box, and my personal box (where SAR notifications are sent)
